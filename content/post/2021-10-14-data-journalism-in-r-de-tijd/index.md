title: Data Journalism in R - De Tijd
---

Presentation by Thomas Segers, a data journalist at De Tijd (https://www.tijd.be).

Thomas covers how he, as a data journalist at De Tijd, creates news stories by means of data analysis. Instead of relying on reports and quotes, they work with raw data sources that they process, analyze and visualize themselves in order to look for new trends, interesting patterns and surprising outliers.
