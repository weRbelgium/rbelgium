title: The rise of R in public health research institutes
---

Presentation by [dr. Robby De Pauw](https://www.robbydepauw.be), researcher at [Sciensano](https://www.sciensano.be).

Robby explains how R is used by researchers at Sciensano (the national health institute in Belgium). There are about 300 researchers in the institute and about 80% are using R. Robby covers 
- how Sciensano moved from SPSS/STATA/SAS to mainly R
- which R packages are in use at Sciensano
- some use cases and data flows covering among others 
    - a shiny app [https://burden.sciensano.be/shiny/mortality](https://burden.sciensano.be/shiny/mortality) about the [Belgian National Burden of Disease Study](https://burden.sciensano.be)
    - data flows for [https://healthybelgium.be](https://healthybelgium.be) 
    - how they collect surge capacity across the hospital system in Belgium (especially relevant given current COVID crisis)

The next meetup will probably be held in February and will cover how [Tabnet](https://mlverse.github.io/tabnet) (a deep learning technique which allegedly is competitive compared to boosting machine learning models) was implemented on top of the torch R package which interfaces with the libtorch C++ library.

You can be kept up to date at upcoming meetups at [https://www.meetup.com/RBelgium](https://www.meetup.com/RBelgium).
>> If you have topics to cover, feel free to contact [one of us](https://www.meetup.com/RBelgium/members/?op=leaders) through Meetup and we will be happy to host it.
